# LEETCODE-Array-3016
**Understanding the Code**

Before we dive into a dry run, let's break down what the code does:

* **Counts character frequencies:** It iterates over the characters in the `word` and counts the occurrences of each character using a `count` array.
* **Sorts character frequencies:** It sorts the `count` array in ascending order, meaning the least frequent character is at the beginning and the most frequent at the end.
* **Calculates minimum pushes:** It iterates over the sorted `count` array from the end (most frequent character). For each character, it calculates the number of pushes required based on its frequency and the current keyboard row (determined by `i / 8`).

**Dry Run Example**

Let's take the word "leetcode" as an example:

1. **Count character frequencies:**
   * `count` array: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

2. **Sort character frequencies:**
   * `count` array: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

3. **Calculate minimum pushes:**
   * Iteration 1: `i = 25`, `count[25] = 1`, `i / 8 = 3`, `ans = 0 + 1 * 4 = 4`
   * Iteration 2: `i = 24`, `count[24] = 1`, `i / 8 = 3`, `ans = 4 + 1 * 4 = 8`
   * Iteration 3: `i = 23`, `count[23] = 1`, `i / 8 = 2`, `ans = 8 + 1 * 3 = 11`
   * Iteration 4: `i = 22`, `count[22] = 1`, `i / 8 = 2`, `ans = 11 + 1 * 3 = 14`
   * Iteration 5: `i = 21`, `count[21] = 1`, `i / 8 = 2`, `ans = 14 + 1 * 3 = 17`
   * Iteration 6: `i = 20`, `count[20] = 1`, `i / 8 = 2`, `ans = 17 + 1 * 3 = 20`
   * Other iterations will not contribute to the sum as `count[i]` is 0 for `i < 20`.

Therefore, the minimum number of pushes required to type "leetcode" is 20.

**Explanation of the Logic**

The code aims to minimize the number of pushes by prioritizing the most frequent characters. By placing them on the later rows of the keyboard, we reduce the number of times we need to switch rows. The `i / 8 + 1` calculation determines the row number for the current character based on its index in the sorted `count` array.

**Key Points**

* Sorting the character frequencies is crucial for optimal placement.
* The `i / 8 + 1` calculation efficiently determines the row number.
* The code assumes a keyboard with 8 rows.
